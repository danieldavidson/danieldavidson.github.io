# About Me
Hi, I'm Daniel. I'm a dad and husband. I guess you could say I break and fix things and spend my time researching interests varying in Computer Science/Information Technology, InfoSec, and occasionally Philosophy and Psychology. I work in the Information Technology sector as a Systems Administrator in Alabama. My background is in system/network administration, linux, python, and information security.

When I'm not hacking or working, I'm busy trying to keep up with my little one and spending time with my beautiful wife. I'm an avid [reader](https://goodreads.com/daniel_reads) and gamer (mainly World of Warcraft.) I also enjoy playing guitar, camping, working out, and watching [anime](https://myanimelist.net/animelist/danieru_anime?status=2).

## Certifications

- Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA)
- Currently working on eJPT

# About this site

> *"How great is the sum of thy thoughts? If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand."*

This site serves as an external memory source to note and share my experiences. It is my intention through this endeavor to document resources and findings that I have to found to be critical to my progress as a ethical hacker and sysadmin professional. I hope, not only will this be a learning experience for myself, but a resource for others as well.

Some fun facts about the setup of this project include:

- Built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a static site generator
- Developed on GitHub and hosted for free ($0) on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
- Content made with [Typora](https://typora.io/) and [Atom](https://atom.io), an amazing open source code editor

Thanks for reading!
