Hi my name is Daniel. I'm a dad and husband. I guess you could say I break and fix things and spend my time researching varied interests. I work in Information Technology as a Systems Administrator in Alabama. My background is in system/network administration, python, and information security.

When I'm not hacking or working, I'm busy catching up with my little one Aidan and spending time with my beautiful wife LJ. I'm also avid reader and gamer (mainly World of Warcraft.) I also enjoy playing guitar, working out, and watching anime.
