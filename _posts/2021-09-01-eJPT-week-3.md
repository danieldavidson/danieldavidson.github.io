Created a study schedule which you can find [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vThAsqZ10T-qImrnpd3tcAIL86El04odR15FhXQqGNkwkEDAXVzXakiEbuLdr0U1AUAINAz4iB1o_Nm/pubhtml). Finished all of the [Penetration Testing Prerequisites path](https://my.ine.com/CyberSecurity/courses/309de2a5/penetration-testing-prerequisites) and I'm working my way through the [Penetration Testing: Preliminary Skills & Programming path](https://my.ine.com/CyberSecurity/learning-paths/a223968e-3a74-45ed-884d-2d16760b8bbd/penetration-testing-student). I've also completed the **TCM: Practical Ethical Hacking - Introduction to Linux section**. You'll notice in my schedule that I tried my best to pair the content of INE's course and TCM's course together in similarity. Same thing with TryHackMe. If I studied BurpSuite in the courses I tried to find a room that complemented that course content.

One thing I'd like to mention is one of the INE lab's covering the use of a tool called [PacketWhisper](https://github.com/TryCatchHCF/PacketWhisper). With this tool, I was able to successfully exfiltrate credentials that were contained in a text file stored on a security-hardened server through DNS and a pcap file.

Reached out to several of my connections on Linkedin to find out if the programming aspect of INE's training would be prevalent on the exam and I was informed that it would not. That said, the programming content is just available as a valuable skill to have as a pentester. I do plan on diving further into coding later to build upon my working knowledge of Python but for right now I'm just trying to laser focus only on what I need to pass the exam.
