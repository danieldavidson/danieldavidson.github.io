Created a study schedule which you can find [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vThAsqZ10T-qImrnpd3tcAIL86El04odR15FhXQqGNkwkEDAXVzXakiEbuLdr0U1AUAINAz4iB1o_Nm/pubhtml). Finished all of the [Penetration Testing Prerequisites path](https://my.ine.com/CyberSecurity/courses/309de2a5/penetration-testing-prerequisites) and I'm working my way through the [Penetration Testing: Preliminary Skills & Programming path](https://my.ine.com/CyberSecurity/learning-paths/a223968e-3a74-45ed-884d-2d16760b8bbd/penetration-testing-student).

Absolutely mind blown by [PacketWhisper](https://github.com/TryCatchHCF/PacketWhisper)! With this tool, I was able to successfully exfiltrate credentials that were contained in a text file stored on a security-hardened server through DNS and a pcap file. All of this is contained in INE's lab of course.

Reached out to several of my connections on Linkedin to find out if the programming aspect of INE's training would be prevalent on the exam and I was informed that it would not. That said, the programming content is just available as a valuable skill to have as a pentester. I do plan on diving further into coding later to build upon my working knowledge of Python but for right now I'm just trying to laser focus only on what I need to pass the exam.
