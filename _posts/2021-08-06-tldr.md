Unpopular opinion I hate man pages.

Yeah I know what you're thinking but hear me out. Without man pages of course most of us would be lost and confused; just fumbling our way around the command-line. Although man pages are such a great resource they can however be quite extensive and hard to find what you need quickly. If that sounds like you then let me introduce you to `tldr`. TLDR is a tool that makes an effort to simplify the beloved man pages with practical examples. Take a look at an example below.
