Yeah, I know what you’re thinking, but hear me out. Without `man` pages of course most of us would be lost and confused; just fumbling our way around the command-line. Although `man` pages are such a great resource they can however be quite extensive and hard to find what you need quickly. If that sounds like you then let me introduce you to `tldr` pages. TLDR is a tool that attempts to simplify the beloved man pages with practical examples. Look at an example below.
