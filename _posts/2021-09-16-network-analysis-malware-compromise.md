**P.S: I highly encourage you to try solving the challenges on your own first then check this writeup if you are stuck.**

**Scenario**

>A SOC Analyst at Umbrella Corporation is going through SIEM alerts and sees the alert for connections to a known malicious domain. The traffic is coming from Sara’s computer, an Accountant who receives a large volume of emails from customers daily. Looking at the email gateway logs for Sara’s mailbox there is nothing immediately suspicious, with emails coming from customers. Sara is contacted via her phone and she states a customer sent her an invoice that had a document with a macro, she opened the email and the program crashed. The SOC Team retrieved a PCAP for further analysis. 

To solve this challenge we are required to download the task file, extract the zip file using the password provided, and analyze the `.pcap` file using [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/).

## **Q.** What’s the private IP of the infected host?
**A.** 10.11.27.101
## **Q.** What’s the malware binary that the macro document is trying to retrieve?
**A.** spet10.spr
## **Q.** From what domain HTTP requests with GET /images/ are coming from?
**A.** cochrimato.com
## **Q.** The SOC Team found Dridex, a follow-up malware from Ursnif infection, to be the culprit. The customer who sent her the macro file is compromised. What’s the full URI ending in .rar where Ursnif retrieves the follow-up malware from?
**A.** http://95.181.198.231/oiioiashdqbwe.rar
## **Q.** What is the Dridex post-infection traffic IP addresses beginning with 185.?
**A.** 185.244.150.230
